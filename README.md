## Homebrew/Linuxbrew compatability
These formula have been developed primarily for Linuxbrew. They may work for OSX, they may not. If you are unsure then look at [Homebrew Science](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science) for more generic solutions.

## How Do I Install these Formula
`brew install andrewyatz/ensembl/<formula>`

Or brew tap `andrewyatz/ensembl` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Troubleshooting
**IMPORTANT** First read the [Troubleshooting Checklist](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/Troubleshooting.md#troubleshooting).).
